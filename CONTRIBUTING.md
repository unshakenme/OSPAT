## FAQ
Below are answers to frequently asked questions.

### Who can contribute?
Anyone with knowledge or experience in the field of psychedelic-assisted therapy is invited to contribute. This includes researchers, clinicians, trainers, and other professional support staff that work with these specialists.

### Will OSPAT provide therapists with a certification recognized by the growing psychedelic-assisted therapy industry?
This is a goal on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/unshakenme/OSPAT/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roadmap), but there are many more questions to answer about how we can verify and validate completion of the curriculum within an open source model. We hope respected entities in the space like MAPS, CIIS, and IPI will work with us and be supportive of the goal to provide an open source certification option at some point in the future. 

### How do I get started contributing?
If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, you will want to take a look at the tutorials. You will need to setup a GitHub account. The basic workflow is to _fork_ this project and begin working on _issues_ or submit a _pull request_. All content is written in _Markdown_.The tutorials will teach you what these developer terms mean and how to do them. It is a slight learning curve, but once you've done it once or twice the process is straightforward.

### Why Open Source?
Open source means anyone in the world can access this curriculum, at any time, free of cost. Existing options for Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy require therapists to go through a centralized entity or gatekeeper, and are subject to the timelines and waiting lists of those entities. With an open source alternative, individuals can jump right in and learn at their own schedules, and the only cost to them is to access the information listed in the curriculum (for example, the cost of purchasing books). Equally as important, with an open source curriculum anyone in the world can access, audit, and contribute to it's content. This enables us to maximize the power of our collective wisdom.

### Why GitHub?
GitHub is the world's leading open source platform for developers. It is where the world's greatest open source projects have started from. While there is a slight learning curve for individuals without development backgrounds, there is a plethora of GitHub documentation available to support anyone who is interested in learning, auditing, or contributing to OSPAT.

## Tutorial Section
Below includes everything you need to get started contributing to OSPAT, with links to tutorials for each step. Skip to step 5 if you are already familiar with GitHub and Markdown.

1. [Setup a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).
2. Learn about issues, pull requests, branches and commits with the GitHub Learning Lab [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course (takes less than one hour). This is how you will contribute directly to the OSPAT repository.
3. Learn how to use Markdown with the short GitHub Learning Lab [Communicating using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) course. This is the format for editing content in the OSPAT repository.
4. Fork the OSPAT repository. If you are unfamiliar with _forks_ read the [What the fork!](https://github.community/t/what-the-fork/10187) article on the GitHub Community Forum, or the GitHub documentation on [Working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks).
5. Find an [Issue](https://github.com/unshakenme/OSPAT/issues) to begin working on, or if you have an idea, submit an Issue of your own!
6. Once you have modified content for the OSPAT repository on your forked version, [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) so it can get updated in the main branch of the official OSPAT repository!
7. If it has been awhile since you've worked on the repository, make sure you [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) before you continue contributing, there may have been a lot of changes that you aren't seeing.
